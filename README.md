# React + Redux + Typescript - Simple Starter

This is one in a billion starter kits out there and it's not quite different as you may expect. The major difference of this project and the others is that it contains the best things that I saw in other starter kits.

TL;DR

## Why?

Just being honest with you guys, I built it for learn. I mean learn by putting all the things that I already learnt together besides the good parts of other starter kits that I saw as I mentioned before.
